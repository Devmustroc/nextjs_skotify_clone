# Spotify Clone Using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Spotify API
### Background

In the lesson [Setup Next.js, ESLint, & TypeScript](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/fullstack-app-next/setup-next-js-eslint-typescript/), Scott scaffolds a new app with `npx create-next-app`. However, there are some dependency conflicts with some of the package versions used in the course so the additional depenencies aren't able to be installed. This repository can be used as a starting point for the remainder of the course.

### Instructions

First, clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FrontendMasters/fullstack-app-next-starter.git
```

Change Directories

```bash
cd full-stack-app-next-starter
```

Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

After installing the dependencies, run the development server:

```bash

```
